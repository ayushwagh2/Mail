I have created two views 1:mail_list_view and 2:mail_detail view 
  In the mail_list_view we can see the total number of mail and the amount of time a mail is being viewed 
    After clicking the readmore button on the mail_list_view +1 value is added to the the views field of the Mail model it keeps on incrementing as many time we press the read more button
